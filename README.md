# Risk
This is an implementation of risk in python. The starting code was obtained from [Whysmerhill](https://github.com/Whysmerhill/Risk), and then function names and comments were translated from french to english. To run this, simply navigate to this directory and type `python GUI.py`. This does depend on a few python libraries listed in risk.yml.

This program simply runs 3 AI's playing the game risk. It currently has a few problems which can lead to a crash or being stuck in a loop.
