# Risk
This is an implementation of risk in python. The starting code was obtained from [Whysmerhill](https://github.com/Whysmerhill/Risk), and then function names and comments were translated from french to english. To run this, simply navigate to this directory and type `python GUI.py`. This does depend on a few python libraries, listed in risk_packages.txt. If it fails to run and talks about a package, that may need to be installed with pip.

Playing the game:
When the game is launched it will display the gameboard with randomly preselected territories for 3 players. The bottom area will display all necessary information for the game, such as the number of units you can add/move around the game. To select a territory you simply click, and to adjust the number of units being placed/attacking/moving can be adjusted using the mouse wheel. After the attacking phase, press `n` to move to the fortification phase. For help during the game, press `h`.
